I have chosen to research another terminal command for this weeks lab and I will be researching the find command and using https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufind.htm as 
my source.

Command: `find . -path`

output ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122575342/224892742-aa0ed525-6950-4462-8a65-8edb73d908ba.png)

this command finds if a file was modified n minutes ago and could be useful for checking the conditions to see if anyone had altered the file.


Command: `find 

output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122575342/224893354-21c0bdf3-1176-4346-9547-f983be3bea47.png)

this command finds if a file is empty and is a useful tool in acessing a file quickly to see if it has contents or not.

Command: find -D stat

output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122575342/224893923-10cf349d-814e-434f-946b-e02436f1d63e.png)

this command lists the entirety of the directory and could be useful when wanting to view a complete display of all files within a directory

Command: find -version

output: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122575342/224894641-18707bdb-8017-40e7-8f0d-bd1bb5c7e06d.png)

this command returns the current version of 'find' and can be useful to determine what commands one will be able to input after learning their version number.
